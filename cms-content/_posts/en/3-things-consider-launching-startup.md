Launching your startup is an exciting time, but it is not the time to rush to launch without thoroughly prepping. Yes, you've been working day and night getting your product or brand ready for its launch, but not properly preparing your business plan and other business essentials before launch could set you behind before even starting.

Regardless of how great your idea may be, the simply fact of the matter is for every successful startup there is also one that is [going to fail](http://blog.gust.com/the-startup-failure-rate-among-angel-funded-companies/). A lot of that comes down to proper preparation. We've compiled four quintessential tips to consider before your big launch, check them out below!

## Market research

Your product may be the greatest thing ever, but if no one wants it then it simply will not sell. While in-depth market research through white papers and forecasts are expensive, if your business can afford it, it can be well worth the money and can give you valuable insights into the potential of your idea.

Even if you can't afford the extensive market research provided by companies who specialize in the field, there are resources available that can help when hammering out your idea. One of the best options for analyzing trends and behaviors is the [Consumer Barometer](https://www.consumerbarometer.com/en/) by Google.

## Bolster your email list

One of the cheapest and easiest ways to get your name out there is through using email lists, both existing and new. We all have people we've met through the years that we can reach out to, but think bigger. Even if you're website hasn't fully launched, having a splash page where interested parties can enter their email address to be alerted to updates and kept abreast with company news. This cheap and easy way of advertising can help generate buzz for your brand before it even launches.

## Become a part of the community

One of the best ways to mold your idea and get valuable feedback is to join a group of like-minded, creative individuals. By joining meetup groups and other social events, you can access to a trove of others that have the same passion and drive as you. Becoming a part of the community can give you an idea of some of the struggles and hurdles you'll face on your startup journey, and it gives you a great networking opportunity.

Don't limit yourself to in-person communities, there are many online communities that can give you valuable friendships and connections.

## Final thoughts

Getting your product to market is the ultimate goal, but you have to properly prepare. Doing the market research should be of top priority to make sure you idea has marketable value. Joining entrepreneurial and startup groups is a great way to bounce ideas off of like-minded people and get greater insights into the market. The key is doing your research across multiple avenues and clearly defining the goals of both your business and yourself.
