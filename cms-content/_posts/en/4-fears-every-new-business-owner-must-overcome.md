Making the leap and starting your own business is no small task. Regardless of how great your idea may or may not be, more goes into a business than just the idea. It can be an overwhelming task, wrought with hurdles and unexpected issues, but you can't let that stop you from pursuing your dreams. Besides just business concerns, one key aspect of starting your business is getting over personal fears.

Below are four fears almost every new business owner goes through and how to quell them.

1. Not knowing where to start: If it's your first business, one of the biggest hurdles to overcome is the lost feeling you get when first starting. Every decision seems monumental and feels like the difference between success and failure. This is not the case, however. You must keep moving forward and taking steps, you will find your path as you go.

2. Friends/family thinking you're crazy: Let's get this out of the way, you are a bit crazy, but that's ok. Giving up a secure job to start your own dream is a bit crazy, but it's how an entrepreneur's mind works. Not wanting to build someone else's dream and instead build your own, is an admirable task, but it isn't the "safe bet." Accept that what you are doing isn't the norm, and push forward.
3. Lack of interest/customers: Hopefully, before starting your business, you did market research to make sure there was a need or space for your business. If so, do not stress about the lack of customers at the start. Interest and customers take time, the key is to continue to be passionate and professional during your start.How you conduct yourself, and how your passion shines through your work, will help bring in customers. It might not be overnight, but persistence is key when starting a business.
4. Unable to handle success: While this seems like a strange fear to have, it's completely understandable. What if you can't deliver on your promises? What if your demand outweighs your time available. What if a client poses a question you can't answer? These are all legitimate concerns, but you can't let them stop you from moving forward. Take one obstacle at a time and you'll get through it.

Starting your own business isn't easy. If it was everyone would work for themselves. It takes a special person who is willing to drop comfort and stability to follow their dreams. Stay strong and persistent and believe in yourself and your team.
