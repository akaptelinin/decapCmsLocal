It can be easy to get in a funk, especially if you're a business owner or entrepreneur. Sometimes, it seems like the more you push forward, the more you're pushed back. It can seem like the whole world is against you and if you aren't prepared for these lows, retreating and giving up on your dream can feel like the only option.

The trick is to not let the lows and negativity get to you, but instead use it as a way to improve yourself and your business. Check out some of our tips below and start looking at your hurdles, and yourself, differently.

## 1\. Accept who you are

Everyone has things they want to improve about themselves, but at a certain level you have to accept who you are. All of your strengths and weaknesses contribute to who you are and those things are what makes you - you. Don't use this as an excuse to stop growing, but don't let it hold you back, either.

## 2\. Give yourself mental breaks

It can be tempting to go full speed 24/7, especially when you're a fledgling startup trying to make your place in the world, but that is a surefire way to burn out. Take Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-a, for example. He gives himself half day mental breaks every two weeks, a full day every month, and 2-3 days straight once a month.

## 3\. Don't let failure break you

Failure isn't fun for anyone, but how you rebound says a lot about you. Successful people don't let failures and missteps define them. They instead accept them, learn from them, and move on. You can't let a small failure ruin everything that you do right.

## 4\. Make decisions and stick with them

This doesn't mean you should make uneducated decisions, but once you've done your research, looked at the possibilities, and came up with what you believe is the best course of action, you make the call and stick with it. Successful people can be wrong, but they'll never be accused of "sitting on the fence" when it's time to decide the next move.

## 5\. Always follow-through

Similar to point number 4, successful people know that ideas are one thing, but it's the follow-through that defines us.  Ideas are a dime-a-dozen, with some being winners and some being losers, but those good ideas will never amount to anything if you're not ready to make the leap and see your ideas come to fruition.
