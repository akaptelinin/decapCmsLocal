Twitter provides a beautiful live, scrolling commentary on nearly any topic you could want. Given the number of hyper-connected tech aficionados in Dublin for this year's Web Summit right now, it's no surprise that some curious observations are bubbling to the surface.

Some are wonky, some are weird, and others are just plain true.

> What is the opposite of data informed? HiPPO - the highest paid person's opinion [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash) — Nicole Melander (@melander) [November 5, 2014](https://twitter.com/melander/status/529943183166160896)

We probably take far too many cues from wealthy people based solely on the fact that they are wealthy.

> Наличие интернета - проблема всех интернет конференций :) [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash) [#Dublin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dublin?src=hash) [#ecoisme](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ecoisme?src=hash) [#mappedinua](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mappedinua?src=hash) — Ivan Pasichnyk (@Ivan_Pasichnyk) [November 4, 2014](https://twitter.com/Ivan_Pasichnyk/status/529737209965182977)

This Russian tweet translates as "Availability of the Internet is the problem of all the Internet conferences." This is a tech conference, after all. Isn't this the most technologically advanced age we've ever lived in? Isn't this event called "Web" Summit? We want to get online while we're here!

> As Marketer "you must beat the kitten" Cheezburger's Ben Huh at [#WebSummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WebSummit?src=hash) [#contentmarketing](https://twitter.com/hashtag/contentmarketing?src=hash) — Judith Denkmayr (@linzerschnitte) [October 31, 2013](https://twitter.com/linzerschnitte/status/395860165632983040)

We assume Ben means "beat" as in "to surpass," not to physically assault.

> Dictionary corner on the machine stage at [#WebSummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WebSummit?src=hash) where the speaker has opened with no less than 12 slides of word definitions... — James Sherwin-Smith (@26left) [November 5, 2014](https://twitter.com/26left/status/529942695796813824)

If you need to kick off your presentation with a glossary, you're doing it wrong.

> [#pitchhop](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pitchhop?src=hash) pitching through hip hop. I hope this catches on. [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/JYLHcwtHgp](http://t.co/JYLHcwtHgp) — 7billionpeople.net (@GregSynnott) [November 5, 2014](https://twitter.com/GregSynnott/status/529943795186806785)

We do not hope this catches on.

> People saying that obviously EVERYONE knows that social is way to go for all companies must have never met logistics companies [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash) — Inga Rós (@Inga_Ros) [November 5, 2014](https://twitter.com/Inga_Ros/status/529941856097161217)

It's an apt point. How and why would a commercial warehousing company need to connect with everyday people online?

> Quote of morning in the hotel lift "doing your taxes is easier than figuring out the [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash) agenda" so true! Ha ha — Keran McKenzie (@keranm) [November 5, 2014](https://twitter.com/keranm/status/529895991173218304)

There are a lot of events, it's true! We'll always feel like we missed out on something.
