This month we’ve added a useful function for kanban boards, revamped task reminders in the Pyrus mobile app and collected all compiled the most popular integrations in an easy-to-use catalog.

**Mobile news**

It’s now a lot easier for iOS and Android users to set task reminders. If you want to come back to a task later, simply hold down **Snooze** to open a pop-up window and set a reminder.

You can set a reminder for preset times such as tomorrow, the weekend or next Monday with one click, in one action; or you can select a specific date and time. All of this is done on one screen, with a minimum number of taps, without opening different windows. Reminders are set with an easy one-tap click!

Android now features a **Calendar Calendar in tasks within a form.**! The clear, compact layout and display will help you to plan your workday more efficiently and process all kinds of tasks on time – from payment and contract approvals to customer support queries.

**To each their own**

The kanban board now have the ability to filter lists. You can now monitor work progress in different aspects and departments, all in seconds.

For example, say you have a list of tasks called **Process Fine-Tuning**, where you monitor all follow-up product development and customer service work via a kanban board. Each person working with this list has their own interests: a department head wants to see the frontline tasks in their own subdivision; a customer manager is interested in the status of queries from a key client; and the CEO wants to see how tasks are delegated by the department.

You can now see all these views on the **Board.** You can manage the process you need, filtering tasks by department or client. The head of Marketing will see their department’s employees’ tasks:

The client manager sees task statuses organized by client:

The CEO sees the overall picture:

**Integrations Catalog**

Pyrus now has a good-looking and convenient [catalog of extensions](https://pyrus.com/en/extensions). It contains integrations with all the popular services, as well as descriptions of what they can do and setup instructions.

The integrations are grouped by field and filtered by tag - from finances and contracts, to client support, chats and social networks. This allows you to quickly select the one you need, see what it can do, set it up in a matter of minutes, and start working with it right away.
