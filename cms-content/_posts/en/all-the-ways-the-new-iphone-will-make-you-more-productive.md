As it always goes, the latest and greatest Apple device is here, and this time there are two of them. Apple’s iPhone 6 has a larger 4.7” screen and the iPhone 6 Plus a still-larger display measuring in at 5.5”. The larger screens right away mean that you can use this not-quite-a-tablet as a more heavy-duty productivity tool. It’s much more comfortable to edit a document or spreadsheet on a screen any size larger than the previous generation iPhone. These new iPhones will feel more like working on a tablet than on your cell phone.  

Here are the other ways these new phablets will help you do more work from a single device.  

**There’s a one-handed mode. Do something with that free hand!**  
We often if not always use our phones one-handed, but people with smaller hands will have difficulty here with such a larger phone. A new one-handed mode will reformat various apps (say, your texting app) into a smaller space on the smartphone screen (to make it easier to access the keyboard, naturally).  

**It still runs all the iOS productivity apps you already use.**  
You’re might be just like so many others — heavily invested in your Evernote, your newsreading app, and whatever else it is that you require to function. As the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will run iOS 8, a new version of Apple’s mobile operating system, everything you’re already doing on your iPad and iPhone can be done on this new device of in-between size.  

It might just replace both of those devices for you.  

**You can pay for stuff with it!**  
Here’s the long story short on Apple Pay: Your phone replaces your credit card. Pretty cool, no?  

**It has a _HUGE_ battery so you can do all these things over and over and over.**  
If you’re operating with a larger screen, that means you have more room to arrange components. Apple wisely reserved a lot of the inside of the new iPhones for battery space. Not only will a larger screen need more juice to stay running through the day, we also want it to last the day. Apple kicked the battery up a notch for everyone’s convenience, and we're most excited about it.
