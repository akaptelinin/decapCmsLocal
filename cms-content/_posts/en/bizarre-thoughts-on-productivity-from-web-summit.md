From sense to nonsense, talking heads were on hand at Web Summit to dish out their thoughts on how companies and employees might make the best of their time and resources to stay formidable competitors in the business landscape. Attendees were on hand to capture their observations and tweet them, of course.

Here are some of the most interesting or inane takeaways.

> Data of Media: Businesses need to use data strategically to increase productivity [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash) [#liveteam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/liveteam?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/XNlqMA04qR](http://t.co/XNlqMA04qR) — Kevin Shore (@kevinshore) [November 6, 2014](https://twitter.com/kevinshore/status/530322275619586048)

This is like saying water is wet. Of course this is true — businesses that don’t engage with their data and customer feedback deserve to fail.

You already know that we’re big opponents of email. It’s only an impediment to getting your work done. Get rid of email to increase productivity? Sounds good to us.

We've already given you a list of reasons why you hated attending Web Summit. Now that the event's over, you've returned to regular life and are no doubt playing catchup on projects, emails, and various responsibilities you had to put on hold while you were networking in Dublin.

> Really enjoyed [@rosenstein](https://twitter.com/rosenstein) talks at [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash) - the work graph for effective teamwork rather than piles of docs/emails — Mike Hughes (@mikehug) [November 5, 2014](https://twitter.com/mikehug/status/530000536410796032)

Justin Rosenstein is co-creator of Asana, another product aimed at cutting down on emails in order to make daily work operations go by more smoothly. People are eager for solutions that can make this happen.

> "Maintaining clarity is THE key habit of highly effective companies." - [@rosenstein](https://twitter.com/rosenstein), co-founder of [@asana](https://twitter.com/asana) [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash) — Vladimir Vulic (@vulicvladimir) [November 5, 2014](https://twitter.com/vulicvladimir/status/529999059797700608)

It's easy to get distracted when you want to do a million different things at once. Rosenstein points out the key thing that differentiates the major players from the forgotten ones: they can maintain the focus and clarity of vision to see fewer things through to the end at a time, rather than try to do everything at once.

> My fav talk on [#websummit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/websummit?src=hash): "The Habits of Highly Effective Companies" by [@rosenstein](https://twitter.com/rosenstein): Have clarity of purpose, plan and responsibilities! — Magnus Rex (@rexikan) [November 5, 2014](https://twitter.com/rexikan/status/530003536625815552)

While maintaining clarity, be sure that you're making plans for the future and clearly assigning responsibilities to the people most capable of handling them.

> Will we ever see [#productivity](https://twitter.com/hashtag/productivity?src=hash) apps that look just great?

Almost all productivity apps look silly. Except Pyrus, of course.
