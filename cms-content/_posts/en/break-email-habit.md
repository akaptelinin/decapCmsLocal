### Why Communication Will Soon Look Very Different

### When Email Is a Full Time Job

If answering your email feels like a full time job, [you're not alone](https://twitter.com/parislemon/status/88818046021537793). The average knowledge worker [spends 2-3 hours a day answering email](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/the_social_economy), at a significant cost in productivity to companies.

Large companies have tried to address the issue from the top down: Thierry Breton, the head of major French systems integrator ATOS [banned all email across the company's 76,000 employees](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-16055310). Many companies continue the [search for alternatives](http://www.macworld.com/article/1167041/stop_using_email_for_everything.html).

There have been a host of proposals for what individuals can do to help. The proponents of the [Email Charter](http://blog.ted.com/2011/06/30/the-email-charter-an-idea-worth-spreading/) have drawn up a list of [twelve best practices](http://emailcharter.org/index.html) they asked everyone to adopt toward doing away with the common blight of email overload. Among them:

- **Spare the CC's**: they multiply "like mating bunnies" and clutter everyone's inbox
- **Cut contentless responses:** "Thanks for your note" is empty and better left unsent

### **Email Habits Are Hard To Break**

Take brevity, for example: Long-winded explanations, justifications, and even social niceties ("Hi Max. How have you been?") take valuable time to write and to read. For the most part, a person reading your email just wants to know: _What is expected of me right now?_

Most people are afraid to just get to the point for fear they might seem rude. But as journalist [Jordan Crook famously pointed out](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/05/i-hate-email/):

> _"If everyone were to cut out all the niceties, everyone would be a bitch. But if everyone did it, no one would be a bitch. And right now, everyone is a bitch. Email’s bitch."_

###  Pyrus Can Help

Pyrus was designed with one principle in mind: get items out of your inbox as quickly as possible so you can focus on real work. To that end, some of the basic Pyrus features include:

- **A single inbox: so you can see at a glance what there is to do next**
- **Every communication is an actionable task**
- **Every task has someone responsible for it; no task is ever lost or left undone**
- **A task disappears from your inbox once you answer or delegate it**
- **You can unsubscribe from irrelevant threads at any time**
- **Intuitively and transparently approve documents and proposals, a crucial feature in corporate environments**
- **Easy search through an entire company's communication, so no interactions are lost if someone leaves the company**
- **Flexibly create forms to handle any workflows according to your own internal processes**

Twenty years from now, it is unlikely that workers will still be mired in the chaotic email practices we use today. Take a tour through all Pyrus features [here](https://pyrus.com/en/product).
