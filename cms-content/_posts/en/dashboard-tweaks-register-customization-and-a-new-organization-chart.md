Our December update covers one-click approval, joining an organization in Pyrus, searching tasks by assignee, and more.

## Reports you need

Different specialists need different data in reports on the same form. In the Help desk form, for example, a support manager checks the time of first response and the time of overdue tickets, and a project manager wants to find out what problems clients are usually reporting.

Now everyone can configure [register columns](/en/help/workflow/register#configuring-columns) and a form [dashboard](/en/help/workflow/dashboard#report-view) to see the most important data.

To customize the dashboard and the register for a specific team, a manager can configure a layout and share it with colleagues. They can save it for further use in their accounts.

## Organization chart

Now you can create and edit the structure of your organization in Pyrus with an  [organization chart](/en/help/administration/organization-edit#organization-structure) that shows the entire hierarchy of your company. You can organize departments, edit their names, and filter employees by department.

To see the chart of your company, visit the **Orgchart** section in your Pyrus account.

## Fast approvals

Previously, you had to select **Approve** and click **Send.** Now you can [approve a request with one click](/en/blog/new-approval-buttons-in-forms). The additional options **Acknowledge** and **Disagree** are still available in a drop-down menu.

## Joining your team

Let’s say you need to join a team that already uses Pyrus. Previously, you had to wait for the administrator to create an account for you, but now there’s another way: when [creating your account](/en/help/account-management/sign-in#new-account), you can click **Join an existing organization.** Pyrus will create a link that you can send to the administrator via messenger or email. When your account is approved, you will receive a notification email.

## Searching by assignee name

Now you can search for [tasks assigned to a colleague](/en/help/tasks/search). It’s convenient for discussing work results with your employees.

You’ll see active tasks by default. To check all the tasks (including closed tasks), use the **Show all** option in the top right menu.

## What’s in the task

In your **Inbox,** you’ll see a task title and the latest comment in it.

That’s all for December. Thank you for being with us.
