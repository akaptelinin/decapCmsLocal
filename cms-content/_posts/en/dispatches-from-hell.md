### Eight Experts Weigh In On Their Email Inbox Agony

![](emailhell.webp)

At Pyrus, we hate email as much as everyone else. It is why we created a platform that structures communication around [tasks](https://pyrus.com/en/product) and [processes](https://pyrus.com/approvals-and-workflows). To highlight the extent of the problem companies face each day, we compiled a fun list of complaints about the communication medium everyone loves to hate: email.

> "I hate email. Hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate email."
> 
> \-- [M. G. Siegler, _TechCrunch_](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/10/tumblrs-new-messaging-system-another-way-to-avoid-my-evil-email-inbox/)

> "\[M\]y inbox... is a disastrously bad todo list."
> 
> \-- [Paul Graham, _Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas: Replace Email_](http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html) 

> "My e-mail inbox is a dejected, endless morass. It’s a desolate wasteland of unanswered messages that continue to appear like a never ending game of Tetris. I can confidently say I hate my inbox and I know I’m not alone. "
> 
> \-- [Nick Bilton, _The New York Times_](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/reinventing-e-mail-one-message-at-a-time/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0)

> "As someone with upwards of 5,000 unread messages at any given time, taking a quick moment to check email is like pushing hot pokers into my eyes."
> 
> \-- [Jordan Crook, _TechCrunch_](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/05/i-hate-email)

> "When I tell people I invented email, the first thing they say is, 'I want to kill you.'"
> 
> \-- [V.A. Shiva Ayyadurai, MIT (via _The Wall Street Journal)_](http://online.wsj.com/articles/v-a-shiva-ayyadurai-on-the-future-of-email-it-gets-better-1404765087)

> "Email is having an increasingly pernicious effect. Not only is it having a perceptible effect on productivity, it’s skewing what it is we focus on. The immediate increasingly crowds out the important."
> 
> \-- [Noreena Hertz, _The Wall Street Journal: The Experts_](http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/05/16/how-email-enslaves-us/?KEYWORDS=email)

> I have never ever been so behind on email as I am right now.
> 
> \-- [Fred Wilson, _A VC_](http://avc.com/2012/02/the-black-hole-of-email/)

> Stop trying to make reply-all happen, it’s not going to happen.
> 
> \-- [Sam Stryker, _BuzzFeed_](http://www.buzzfeed.com/samstryker/stop-replying-all-you-fools)
