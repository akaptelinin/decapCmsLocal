_Ed Zitron is founder and CEO of EZ-PR._

**Who are you and what do you do?**  

My name is Ed Zitron and I run a small three-person PR firm in San Francisco, Portland, Boston and NYC. We have a distributed team, on different timezones, doing vastly different tasks that mostly emanate from me. I also have many clients that I need to get to do stuff so that I can do things to make their campaigns work. This also occasionally means I have 2-3 people that I have to check something off with. While my main thrust is getting coverage for clients, that requires a fair amount of research.  

One thing I have is also my personal assistant Royal Hebert who I use both for work and personal tasks.  

**How much do you rely on email in general? Huge part of your work life?**  

There is no way in which you cannot read this as a total understatement: I live my life on email. I almost conduct my entire business on email. It is actually rather ridiculous how much of my life let alone my business is run across email. I'm an English ex-pat but connect with my parents and family in London via email too. Everything happens there. It's the dissonant insane hub of my life.  

**Before Pyrus, how much email did your team send and receive in a day to go about business?**  
I cannot put a real number on this but let's just say a lot of "did you get this?" and "what's this version" and "uh, I'm not sure where to put this" and really, really mind-numbingly simple questions that made me kind of upset, but they had to be done.  

**After Pyrus?**  
I'd say I've lost about 40% of my "what am I doing" emails which was a large chunk of my business emails. My internal team is how I use it — externally, it's slow to bring in clients not because of the system but because I want to slowly roll out new programs. I love Pyrus, though, because it means when i assign something to a team it's got the whole to-do-list mentality - but also a really organized way of seeing if things are actually being done. And if it's a document, it's attached. If it's a thing I need to fill in, I have it there.  

**Any particular features proven to be favorites?**  
Psychological relief. I know when something isn't in my inbox it's someone else's problem to fix. If it's in my inbox but read, I know it's something I need to address. It works like email. In fact i didn't watch any of the tutorial videos, I just jumped in and worked out how to do it - and it just worked like Gmail with tags for projects. It works naturally. I'm not particularly good at learning new tools, and I barely had to learn anything.  

**Any situations that would’ve been an email nightmare that Pyrus made easier?**  
Just the usual "did this get done?" situation. I can comment on a Pyrus task, or I can just see if the task is done. Or when it's done they say "hey, it's done!" and I get an email with the work result. It's a blend between a task manager and an email platform. It makes sense. It doesn't require me to change my thought patterns. I'm not being made to completely change how I work. Which is why I've failed to pick up any other platform than Pyrus for workflow.
