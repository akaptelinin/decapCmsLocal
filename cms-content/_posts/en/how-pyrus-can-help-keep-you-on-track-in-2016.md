Pyrus is a great way to monitor employees, delegate tasks, and organize your contacts. The powerful tools make dividing up responsibilities easy and can help streamline assignments between you and your team. But you can also use Pyrus as a tool for yourself, as well.

With the New Year still fresh in everyone's mind, I'm sure you have made some New Year's resolutions and you can use Pyrus to keep you on track, in business and life.

Losing weight and getting in shape is one resolution that many people make at the start of the year, so let's use that as our first example.

You're not going to only work out for a week then call it quits, so use "**Recurring Tasks**" to set up your schedule.

This will be the foundation on which you build your workout plan. Recurring tasks can also be set to send email reminders meaning if you don't log into Pyrus that day you'll still get an email reminding you that it's time to workout!

Another resolution you'll see many make is the desire to make home improvements. Deadlines are of huge importance when improving one's home so you're not left with a half finished bathroom or kitchen.

Let's see how we can do that in Pyrus. First, let's create a new "**Project**."

Once your project is created, you'll need to create some new "**Tasks**" to go in there.

As you can see, when creating a new task you can assign it to a Project, a person, and assign a due date to keep you on track.

Once you have created all tasks needed, you can see an overview within your Project.
