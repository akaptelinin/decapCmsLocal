As many of you have probably already noticed, we have a new function of Pyrus, the ability to receive notifications right in your browser. By adding this, you can be informed the moment someone gives you a task or comments on one you’re following. The notification pops up in the bottom right corner of the screen and looks like this.

After you click the message, you will be directed to the page of the task in Pyrus and can start working on it from there.

If you already see these notifications, then you have already accepted the notification from your browser to enable notifications from Pyrus. That option is available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari.

If in the last month you used Pyrus in one of the browsers listed above, but still do not receive notifications, then it means you’ve refused to accept them from your browser. Don’t worry, it’s very easy to enable them. Log in to Pyrus, click on the ‘wheel’ in the upper right corner and go to Preferences. Click ‘Edit’ in Notifications field and put a mark at ‘When any of my tasks change’ in the “Desktop” group. If you find you do not care for the notifications, this is where you can turn them off, as well.

As soon as you enable pop up notifications from Pyrus, your browser will ask for your permission to show these messages. The same question will appear to people who access their accounts the first time after the function was introduced, just signed up, or use a new browser.

Many people are already used to using push notifications in mobile apps and with wearables like the Apple Watch, so it was fitting to add this functionality into Pyrus, as well. We hope that you will also like this new function of the web version!

As a reminder, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome still have an option to track the work process with a simple counter of incoming unread tasks. To see that notification, just install a plugin for your browser: click the ‘puzzle’ icon in the upper right corner of Pyrus, select your browser and agree to the installation.

And as always, there is still the option to do it the traditional way and simply receive notifications through your email.
