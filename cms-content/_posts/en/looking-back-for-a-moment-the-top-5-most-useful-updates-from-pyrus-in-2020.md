We are constantly developing Pyrus, adding new functions and capabilities to streamline your business processes and tasks. Over the last year we have released many updates — some of them hidden and practically unnoticeable, some long-awaited by our clients.

Here are the most useful features to appear in Pyrus in 2020.

**Integrations with social networks and messengers**

You can now receive client requests in Pyrus, directly from all the popular social networks: F, Facebook Messenger, Telegram. Just install the extension you need, and messages from clients will appear in your Inbox as tasks. You won’t miss a single message or comment from your client. Reply to frequently asked questions with ready-made answersit will allow you to process a higher volume of requests at the same time. [Try it out](https://pyrus.com/en/help/integrations/instagram)!

**Zoom meetings right in the task**

2020 has brought big changes to the usual way of doing business. We have all begun to rely much more on video communication for work. So, we have added the capability of creating a Zoom meeting right in a Pyrus task. When you schedule a meeting, all the participants you indicate receive a notification with the date and time, the link and the password. You can join thiscall directly from the same task.

**Registering several organizations with one email**

You no longer need a separate email address for every organization you want to create in Pyrus. You can create as many organizations in the same account, and with the same email, as you need. This new feature is useful for those who use Pyrus on several teams simultaneously, or for successful entrepreneurs who run more than one company.

**Improvements to working with tasks**

We’ve added several small improvements to the way tasks are organized. They are not as obvious as larger new features, but they do make working in the system much more convenient.

You can now pin important tasks at the top of your Inbox, and group tasks into folders by form, stage, and role.

The search function has also been reconfigured with more filters to make finding the task you’re looking for faster and easier.

We have added a [Similar tasks extension](https://pyrus.com/en/help/integrations/similar-tasks) so you can see all previous requests from the same client.

You can now use hot buttons to switch between tasks, get documents approved, and change the system settings even more quickly and conveniently.

Finally, at the end of the year, we [have made the toolbar](https://pyrus.com/en/blog/updated-pyrus-control-panel) more compact and streamlined.

**Pyrus — free forever**

This is our most important update. We know 2020 was a difficult year for business and entrepreneurs. So, as of this Summer, we have made Pyrus free for teams of any size, without limits on the number of tasks or messages.

Create tasks, monitor their completion, discuss work issues and move forward with us!
