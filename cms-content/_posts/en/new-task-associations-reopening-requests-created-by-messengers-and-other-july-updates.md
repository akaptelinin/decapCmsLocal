This past month, we updated tools that have been a hit with Pyrus users for a long time.

**1.** Now you can check **how tasks are associated**. There are two ways to link tasks in Pyrus. The first is to divide one big task into several smaller ones to track their progress. The second is to post a link to the task in a comment on another task.

Now associated tasks have a clear relationship:

- parent task (the task from which we create subtasks)
- subtask
- simple linked task

To see these associations, click on the button to the right of **Associated tasks**.

**2.** You can edit tables in forms **at the same time** as your colleagues. All the data that everyone adds to the tables will be saved.

**3.** Now you can **reopen closed requests that were created from Telegram, Viber, and Facebook messages**. For example, a client discussed delivery time with the support team, and a week later, he has a question about the warranty. He returned to the old thread to discuss a new subject. It’s better to handle this as a new request, and now you can set Pyrus to do so.

**4.** You can **customize the company logo display** in the web form for customer orders. If you don’t want the logo to appear, uncheck the pre-installed checkbox on the web form settings.

**5.** Now the **live chat for websites and mobile apps can transfer the customer’s name to the automatically created request.** When a user chats with a support specialist, he is able to immediately address him by name.
