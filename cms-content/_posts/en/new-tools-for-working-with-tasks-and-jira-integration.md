New Pyrus features for March: splitting tasks into steps, following tasks, planning the day, and creating Jira tickets for developers within Pyrus with a single click.

## Using Pyrus to create Jira tickets for developers

To resolve a client’s request, a support manager will sometimes need help from developers. If your development team uses Jira, you can use [Pyrus’s Jira integration](/en/help/integrations/jira) to collaborate more closely and resolve incidents more quickly. Support managers can create tickets for developers with a single click in Pyrus, and they can monitor any status changes just as easily.

## A new menu and new features for managing tasks

We’ve added new features that will help you manage your Inbox more effectively. For example, now you can follow a task and make it part of your plan for today.

Recent — these are the tasks you participate in.

- **Today —** tasks that you marked **For today.**
- **Reminders —** tasks you’ve set a reminder for.
- **Hidden —** tasks that you’ve hidden.
- **Following —** tasks you’re following. You can follow tasks even if you aren’t participating in them.
- **Recurring —** [templates](/en/help/tasks/recurring-tasks) for creating scheduled tasks.
- **All tasks —** all tasks you can access.
- **Analytics —** an [efficiency report](/en/help/tasks/time-spent) that shows how many tasks were completed on time, how many were overdue, and how long each task took to complete.
- **Library —** a storage for your files and documents. Here you can add any files and attach them to tasks.

**Inbox, Recent,** and **Forms** appear on top of the menu by default. You will also see **Announcements** when there are new unread posts. Other options are kept under **More.**

To make a hidden item visible in the menu, make it one of your favorites. Open the corresponding page and click the star icon in the top right corner under your avatar.

## Splitting a tasks into steps

Splitting a task into steps is useful for managing irregular processes. Suppose you need to approve a payment or a new project plan, but don’t have a form for it. In that situation, you would create a task and split it into steps. Add participants to each step, then add yourself to the final step. When all the participants in the first step reply with **Approved, Acknowledged,** and **Disagree,** the task will move on to the next step. When it’s your turn to act, the task will appear in your **Inbox.**
