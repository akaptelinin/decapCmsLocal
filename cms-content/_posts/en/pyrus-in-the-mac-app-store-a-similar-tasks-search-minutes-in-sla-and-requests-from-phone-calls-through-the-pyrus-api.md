We’re talking about Pyrus for Apple desktops, new capabilities for client’s requests proceeding, and about how our API methods help connect Pyrus to your telephony.

**Pyrus in the Mac App Store**

Pyrus is now available in the Mac App Store - the app store for Apple users. It takes only a couple minutes [to install Pyrus on your Mac](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pyrus-team-communication/id385251753). Receive task updates, without ever opening a browser.

**All requests from the same client, on one screen**

With the **Similar tasks** extension you can see all previous requests from the client, displayed next to the current inquiry. The extension will also immediately scan each new Pyrus inquiry, according to parameters you set up. For example, you can have the extension scan new inquiries by client’s full name, phone number, or email. All inquiries with the same info are displayed in the panel on the right.

This is convenient for operators, as they can immediately see when, how often, and with what questions a client has contacted the service desk. This means the response to the client’s need will be faster, and more precise.

**Minutes in SLA**

This update is good news for those who work with client inquiries constantly, and use SLA (service level agreement) rules to set up the parameters of the service clients receive. With SLA, you can now tell the exact time of response to client issues, down to the minute. This allows much more flexibility in the way the inquiry processing system is set up, and for clients’ problems to get solved more quickly.

**Customer satisfaction in the mobile chat**

Your customers can now evaluate support specialists in the mobile app chat. When a client receives notification that their problem has been resolved, they are also invited to evaluate the quality of service on a scale of 1-5. So, you receive more data on customer satisfaction and employee efficacy.

**Pyrus API for processing phone calls**

Now, you can use API methods [to connect](https://pyrus.com/en/help/integrations/api-telephony) Pyrus to your telephony. When your operator answers a phone call from a client, Pyrus automatically opens an inquiry window. Once the phone call is finished, the audio recording of it is automatically attached to the inquiry. This is especially convenient for resolving problem situations quickly, as it allows you to reconstruct all the details of the conversation in full.
