You can respond to, approve, reject, or complete a pending task right from your wrist. New tasks that arrive to your Pyrus inbox show up instantly on your LG G Watch or Samsung Gear Live as notifications. You can view the full content of a task on your watch and take action immediately. If the task needs a response or approval, you can do so right on the watch interface. Or if you prefer to deal with the task later, just swipe it away.

Pyrus has long been available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.papirus.androidclient&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pyrus-mobile/id385251753?mt=8), and [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/pyrus/8a6a9b50-6a90-4285-ab30-0504e9ac9bbc). This new support means you can perform many of the quick-response actions on an incoming task without ever taking out your smartphone.
