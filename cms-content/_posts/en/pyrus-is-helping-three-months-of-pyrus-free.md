As we all self-isolate to weather the worldwide COVID-19 crisis, companies large and small are moving their employees to work-from-home options, and we are all struggling to figure out a new normal. While working remotely can be a great solution for social distancing, it needs to be convenient for employees, maintain business continuity, and not subject companies to risks."

We hope you, your family, and your team are healthy and well (and staying sane) during these trying times. As we all self-isolate to weather the worldwide COVID-19 crisis, companies large and small are moving their employees to work-from-home options, and we are all struggling to figure out a new normal. While working remotely can be a great solution for social distancing, it needs to be convenient for employees, maintain business continuity, and not subject companies to risks.

These goals are easy to meet when you have a platform that allows you to communicate, set tasks and monitor their completion, and coordinate all kinds of questions, documents, and projects in one place — all from any device, wherever you are.

Pyrus is here for you and your team. We recognize that businesses and employees are facing unprecedented pressures from economic, social, and health stressors. We want to do our part to help relieve at least some of the burden.

**Therefore, we are now offering Pyrus completely free for as many users as you need, for 3 months. All features included. Simply sign up for Pyrus between March 26th and April 30th — no credit card required.**

We can’t replace in-person interactions, but Pyrus can help ensure that your team can still work efficiently, communicate effectively, and keep track of everything while you are working remotely. Together, we can get through this.
