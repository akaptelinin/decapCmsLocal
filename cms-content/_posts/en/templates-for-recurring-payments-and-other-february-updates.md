New Pyrus features for February: creating and blocking dates in the Members report, opening an attached file in a new tab, and asking for a new decision in a task.

## Recurring forms for regular events

Dates are known in advance for tasks like regular payments. Now you can [make those forms recur regularly](/en/help/workflow/recurring-forms), and Pyrus will do the rest. Just fill in the form fields and make it recurrent. The form will automatically be created at the scheduled time and sent for approval.

## Re-approving tasks

You can make your decisions in a task using Approve, Acknowledge, or Disagree. You can find all statuses sent by other participants in the Participants section in the right panel.

[To request a decision](/en/help/tasks/working-on-tasks-together#approving-tasks) from a colleague again, click on the icon next to the colleague’s name.

The decision will be revoked, and a comment mentioning the colleague will appear in the task. This makes it clear that you’re expecting them to take action on something.

## Viewing an attached file in a new tab

It’s sometimes convenient to open a task and [attached documents in different tabs](/en/help/tasks/files#viewing-files-attached-to-a-task). For example, an accountant might open a task in one window and an invoice in another to compare information. To do this, just click on the **Open in new tab** icon in the top menu.

## Dates when members were created or blocked

Now you can see the dates when a user was added or blocked in the [downloaded Excel file](/en/help/administration/user-management). Go to the **User management** page and export the report. The dates in the downloaded file will be noted in the **Creation date** and the **Block date** columns.
