**DO GIVE:**  

**A comfy chair.** Your workaholic friend no doubt spends a lot of time crouched in front a computer. Why not make this an easier, more relaxing experience for him or her? Try the delightful kitsch of a super-comfortable La-Z-Boy for some office furniture that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Put a pin in the seat so they don’t spend too much time staring at screens.  

**A new calendar.** It’s a gift that says “I know you’re busy and acknowledge that you only know how to manage time by scheduling it out in one-hour blocks.” For an added bonus, fill out every date with mandatory time that the recipient has to spend with you — it’s giving yourself a gift at the same time.  

**Some nice pens.** A fine writing instrument can make those back-of-napkin concept sketches pop. And the signatures on all that legal paperwork will absolutely shine as your friend makes the move to sell his or her company!  

**Sales and client leads.** It’s a way of saying “I love you” in a language that they understand.  

**DON’T GIVE:**  

**A cat.** This is a bad idea. Do not get your workaholic friend a living thing that depends on his or her having some semblance of spare time to keep another thing alive. Cats are easy to care for, but they’re terrible employees.  

**An all-expenses-paid vacation.** Not only are these expensive as hell, but your friend likely has no idea how to handle unstructured time (hence the calendar suggestion above).  

**An iTunes App Store gift card.** You will never see your friend’s face again, as it will be buried in an iPhone screen, playing with all the cool new apps he or she just downloaded.  

**A Tempurpedic pillow.** Your friend doesn’t sleep enough to get any mileage out of these delightful pillows that form to the shape of your head. It’s like laying on a glove full of lotion, and it will be totally wasted on someone who’s busy agonizing over sales or clients or share prices as they drift off to a mostly restless sleep.  

**Action items.** As if your friend needs more things to do.
