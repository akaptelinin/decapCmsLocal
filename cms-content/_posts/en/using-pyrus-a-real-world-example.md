We can tell you all the reasons why you _should_ use Pyrus to manage your team and workflow, but why don't we show you a real world example? This writer not only blogs for Pyrus, but uses Pyrus in his day-to-day life to manage and work with a consulting firm dedicated to obtaining funding for nonprofit organizations. Keep reading below to see how we use it to keep track of clients, deadlines, and recurring events!

When working with clients, their dates tend to change, but that doesn't mean yours can! Use the Inbox to see what needs to be worked on, and then use **Today** and **Scheduled** to break it down into smaller, easily digested chunks.

When managing multiple clients, it's best to create **Projects** so you can focus on one of them at a time. This keeps you from feeling overwhelmed and keeps you on the task at hand. Notice that our client is two days late on the delivery of press material, so it highlights it in red for us.

When dealing with multiple clients it is also a good idea to set up **Forms** in order to simply certain things. Forms are another way to streamline the workflow process. Simply click on Forms in the left hand column, and **Create a Form Template.**

Simply drag and drop what information you'll need when someone fills out the form, and add any relevant comments. From there, go the **Workflow** tab to assign a user to the task for when the form is filled out.

Now that someone is assigned to the task, any time the form is filled out with a new contact or client, they will receive the tasks associated with it automatically.

Recurring events are something we have to manage, as well. One example is that we help clients with their social media presence, but only once a week. It's something that is easy to forget about on a Monday morning, but that is why we set these types of things up in **Recurring Tasks**.

Depending on your position, sometimes you need to look at the grand scheme of your workflow to keep up-to-date on everyone's projects and progress. If you're trying to manage your team and need a complete overview of the tasks at hand, you can also look at **All Tasks,** which can be found under **Lists**.

So there you have it! A day in the life of a consulting firm that uses Pyrus to manage workflow and complete tasks in the most efficient way.
