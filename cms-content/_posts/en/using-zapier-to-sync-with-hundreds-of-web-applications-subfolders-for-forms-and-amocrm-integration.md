Pyrus has integrated with Zapier, a web service that makes two apps work together easily. You select the application for Pyrus to interact with and set terms for this interaction.

When a trigger event happens in the system, Pyrus automatically fills out the request form. Zapier supports more than 1,500 applications, so you can configure all kinds of integrations with Pyrus (using zaps) for easily transferring critical business data from one application to another. The main thing is that you do not have to wait for Pyrus’s direct integration to work with the app you need.

We demonstrated how to integrate Pyrus with Pipedrive CRM using Zapier.

When a deal in Pipedrive gets closed (a trigger fires), Pyrus automatically performs the action of creating a client order form, which appears in the assignee’s inbox.

By comparison to a usual task, the form request lets you use the dashboard to analyze the quality of request performance by various criteria. You can configure these criteria in the form fields.

## New features for working with forms

Now you can add subfolders to your folders to more conveniently work with forms. For example, you can add **Travel, Vacation,** and **Working hours** forms in the **Employees** subfolder, which is located in the **Internal Documents** folder. Subfolders with various client request forms can be added in the **Сustomer support** folder.

## Pyrus + amoCRM

We integrated Pyrus with amoCRM. If you use this service, you can work with won leads in Pyrus. The salesforce manages clients in CRM systems until they become real customers. Then the client order should be transferred to the delivery service or to client support.

This transfer will be quicker and more convenient in light of this new integration. After closing a deal, a won lead automatically appears in assignee’s inbox as a client request.
