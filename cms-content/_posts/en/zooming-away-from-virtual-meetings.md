That’s because of all the ways these meetings fail to replicate natural conversational settings and strain our brains.

Are you exhausted by virtual meetings? So am I. So are many of us. [Even CEOs](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/14/923428794/from-the-folks-who-brought-you-boring-meetings-ceos-want-to-ditch-sterile-zoom-c) are getting sick of virtual meetings. That’s because of all the ways these meetings fail to replicate natural conversational settings and strain our brains. The phenomenon colloquially termed “Zoom fatigue” has skyrocketed, and so has our search for solutions. [This data from Google](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=zoom%20fatigue&geo=US) reveals that the frequency of the search term skyrocketed in April and remains significantly higher than it was before the onset of the pandemic in early 2020.

Fortunately, there are some solutions, strategies, and technological tools we can harness to address this problem. Drawing from the advice of various experts, I have compiled some major categories of solutions we should consider to save ourselves, and our teams, from “Zoom fatigue.”

### **Seeing Double… or Many Times That**

One of the major challenges of virtual meetings is the overwhelming and unnatural amount of visual information hitting our brain’s processing system at once. [This BBC Worklife article](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200421-why-zoom-video-chats-are-so-exhausting) describes both the specific issues of this domain and some solutions to try. Perhaps the most obvious difference between meeting in person and over video call is the presence or absence of nonverbal cues. This includes turn-taking cues we give and respond to subconsciously in natural conversations, as described by Laura Dudley, the psychology professor at Northeastern cited in [this article](https://news.northeastern.edu/2020/05/11/zoom-fatigue-is-real-heres-why-youre-feeling-it-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/). In a virtual environment, we don’t pick up on a sharp intake of breath or someone’s change in posture like we would in person. Nonverbals like these are much more difficult to notice and decipher on a screen. 

Further, as [this HBR article](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue) points out, we’re not used to staring directly at speakers to indicate our attention. When people meet in person, it’s considered perfectly acceptable for you to glance to the side every so often. In fact, a constant gaze would likely feel quite uncomfortable in a normal conversation. However, when we meet virtually, each from their own distracting space, we feel a pressure to gaze directly at the screen for the entire meeting to indicate our attention. That’s fatiguing our brains.

Finally, while we stare at our meetings, we feel them staring at us. As [this article](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200421-why-zoom-video-chats-are-so-exhausting) explains, the constant presence of your own image on screen causes you to attend to your appearance more than you would in a regular meeting. In virtual meetings, we become hyper-aware of how we look and begin to feel the kind of anxiety we’d ordinarily associate with performances on a stage. That pressures and exhausts your mind further.

### **A** Clearer **View**

Fortunately, there are strategies to improve the visual experience of a virtual meeting. [This article](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200421-why-zoom-video-chats-are-so-exhausting), among others, encourages meeting facilitators to allow participants to turn off their cameras when they are not speaking. Not only does this reduce the amount of visual input for everyone, it also gives permission to each person to focus on the speaker, not their own image. That reduces anxiety and simulates the kind of attentional focus people would ordinarily give the speaker in a regular meeting.

Even when video is required, you can take steps to make the visual layout of your screen less fatiguing. As [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2020/09/29/beat-zoom-fatigue-with-these-6-tips/#53a0a30f2118) suggests, switch from Gallery view to Speaker view when you can to focus on the speaker only. If you feel the need to stay in Gallery view, you can also hide your self view, as [this HBR article](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue) recommends. These small and simple steps can make a profound impact on your fatigue after a meeting.

### **Hearing Things?**

Another challenge of virtual meetings involves the auditory input. As [this insightful Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marksparrow/2020/08/07/why-do-we-suffer-from-zoom-fatigue-its-all-about-the-sound/#44113004d87a) highlights, the spatial information that is ordinarily attached to sound fails to come through in virtual meetings. Where in person, you could hear who is speaking, on a screen, you may find yourself constantly searching for the speaker. The article discusses some 3D audio technology in the works to improve this issue, but one step you can take already is using Speaker view so that the speaker’s video is automatically highlighted. 

Unfortunately, that doesn’t address all the challenges of virtual meeting audio. The technology itself can act up, and distorted sound isn’t just unpleasant. [This research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1071581914000287) discovered that a lag in audio on a virtual communication platform caused participants to interpret the other speaker as inattentive, even though the lack of immediate responses was due to technological, not attentional, issues. When the technology is just not cooperating, it may not be worth fighting it. Instead, as [this HBR article](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue) reminds us, the phone remains available. In many situations, an ordinary call will suffice.

### **Draining the Flood of Meetings in Your Calendar**

Even with these strategies, meetings are an imperfect solution to all problems. As I suggested at the end of the last section, a phone call often suffices. Moreover, not every task requires a meeting. [This NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/14/923428794/from-the-folks-who-brought-you-boring-meetings-ceos-want-to-ditch-sterile-zoom-c) delineates between tasks that can be done just fine remotely and those that really require collaboration. When a meeting needs to be called, not every person available necessarily needs to be present. [This Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinecomaford/2020/07/25/beat-zoom-fatigue-in-4-neuroscience-savvy-steps/#6bf0eaf42fc5) recommends assigning a role to each participant to keep them engaged in virtual meetings. Don’t know what someone’s role is? Leave them out. To supplement large meetings, use a tool like [Pyrus](https://pyrus.com/en/product). Pyrus allows you to share information between team members easily and quickly, much more efficiently than in meetings.

[This article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashiraprossack1/2020/09/29/beat-zoom-fatigue-with-these-6-tips/#53a0a30f2118) recommends structuring meetings that do happen with an agenda to improve their efficiency. [My earlier blog post on virtual meeting etiquette](https://pyrus.com/en/blog/pinkies-up-and-volume-down-the-etiquette-of-virtual-meetings) makes similar suggestions to improve the meeting experience and increase efficiency.

### **Show Compassion for Context**

Finally, remember that we are all in challenging circumstances these days. Our virtual meetings are happening in the midst of a global pandemic. Help yourself feel less drained by implementing some of [this article](https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-combat-zoom-fatigue)’s tips, like avoiding multitasking and scheduling regular breaks. If you’re leading a meeting, consider the strategy suggested by [this article](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200421-why-zoom-video-chats-are-so-exhausting) of starting meetings with wellness check-ins. Giving space for people to talk about their wellbeing can help relieve some of the external stress being brought into meetings. And if you’re a speaker, follow [these tips](https://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2020/09/17/are-you-causing-zoom-fatigue/#4c7044ca4753) to engage your listeners and facilitate group participation in conversation. Virtual meetings don’t have to just be exhausting. In an isolated world, they can also provide us with opportunities to connect, show compassion, and share meaningful information to move our work forward.
